<h3>🎉 Thank You!</h3>
Your patience and support made this major update possible. It’s been a long time coming, but the app is now faster, more stable, and more flexible.
<br><br>
Here’s what’s new:
<br><br>
<b>💻 Complete Code Overhaul</b><br>
Everything has been rewritten from scratch for better stability and performance. The interface remains familiar — you won’t get lost!
<br><br>
<b>🎨 Flexible Appearance Customization</b><br>
Customize the app’s theme to match your style. Experiment with colors and make the app truly yours!
<br><br>
<b>🔗 Deep Link Integration</b><br>
Instead of a Tasker plugin, I’ve added deep link support. This opens up automation possibilities in any app or workflow!
<br><br>
<h4>Important Notes:</h4>
<br>
<b>📱 Landscape Mode Temporarily Disabled</b><br>
It’ll return in a future update. For now, enjoy a polished portrait experience without surprises!
<br><br>
<b>🌐 Updated IP Detection Logic</b><br>
If you used this feature, please review your settings — everything can be reconfigured.
<br><br>
<h4>Need to Know:</h4>

<b>🛠 I Develop This App Solo</b><br>
I’ve tested everything thoroughly, but if you spot a bug, let me know! Your feedback is crucial for fixes.
<br><br>
<b>Thank You for Believing in This Project!</b><br>
