Unlock your server's secret knock!
Knock on Ports is the ultimate port knocking client for Android, giving you secure and seamless access to services hidden behind firewalls.

Craft custom knock sequences using UDP, TCP, or ICMP packets (IPv4/IPv6 support) to keep your server ports stealthy until the right "knock" unlocks them.
